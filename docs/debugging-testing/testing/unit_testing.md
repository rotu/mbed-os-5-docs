# Unit testing

This document describes how to write and test unit tests for Mbed OS. To prevent and solve problems, please see the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## Introduction

Unit tests test code in small sections on a host machine. Unlike other testing tools, unit testing doesn't require embedded hardware, and it doesn't need to build the full operating system. Because of this, unit testing can result in faster tests than other testing tools. Unit testing takes place in a build environment where we test each C or C++ class or module in isolation. This means we build test suites into separate test binaries and stub all access outside to remove dependencies on any specific embedded hardware or software combination. This allows us to complete the testing using native compilers on the build machine.

## Prerequisites

Please install the following dependencies to use Mbed OS unit testing.

- GNU toolchains.
   - GCC 6 or later. We recommend you use MinGW-W64 on Windows, but any Windows port of the above GCC versions works.
- CMake 3.19.0 or newer.
- Python 2.7.x, 3.5 or newer.

## Test code structure

Unit tests are located in the `tests/UNITTESTS` subdirectory of each library. We recommend that unit test files use an identical directory path as the file under test. This makes it easier to find unit tests for a particular class or a module. For example, if the file you are testing is `some/example/path/ClassName.cpp`, then all the test files are in the `UNITTESTS/some/example/path/ClassName` directory. Each test suite needs to have its own `CMakeLists.txt` file for test CMake configuration.

All the stub source files are built in a stub CMake library targets (e.g `mbed-stubs-rtos`) and linked to the `mbed-stubs` CMake target. The CMake target of the library unit under test is expected to link with the required stub libraries or `mbed-stubs`if it requires multiple stub libraries.

The new stub file should follow the naming convention `<CLASS_NAME>_stub.cpp` for the source file and `<CLASS_NAME>_stub.h` for the header file. They should be built as part of their respective stub CMake library. Alternatively, create a stub library if `<CLASS_NAME>_stub` is an implementation for an external source not part of the Mbed OS.

All the Mbed OS header files are built with CMake `INTERFACE` libraries (e.g`mbed-headers-platform`). Stubbed header files reside in the `UNITTESTS/target_h` and are built with the `mbed-headers-base` CMake library. All CMake libraries containing header files are linked with `mbed-headers`. The CMake target of the library unit under test is expected to link with the required header file libraries or `mbed-headers` in case of requiring multiple header libraries. 

All the stub libraries and header libraries are defined under `UNITTESTS/stubs/` directory.

Libraries for fakes are under `UNITTESTS/stubs/` directory. These provide mock implementations that are meant to replace the stub version that do nothing. Usually these will replace the header files as well as the source files and cannot be used together with their stub equivalents.

### Test discovery

Registering unit tests to run happens automatically, and the test runner handles registration. However, test suites do not automatically build. 

For the build system to build a unit test, pass the `ON` or `OFF` value to `MBED_BUILD_UNITTESTS` in the command-line to include all the unit test suite directories into the build.

### Writing unit tests

A unit tests suite consists of one or more test cases. The test cases should cover all the functions in a class under test. All the external dependencies are stubbed including the other classes in the same module. Avoid stubbing header files. Finally, analyze code coverage to ensure all code is tested, and no dead code is found.

Please see the [documentation for Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/docs/primer.md) to learn how to write unit tests using its framework. See the [documentation for Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googlemock) if you want to write and use C++ mock classes instead of stubs.

#### Test suite configuration

Create two files in the test directory for each test suite:

- Unit test source file (`test_ClassName.cpp`).
- Unit test CMake configuration file (`CMakeLists.txt`).

List all the required files and libraries for the build in the `CMakeLists.txt` file.

#### Example

With the following steps, you can write a unit test. This example creates dummy classes to be tested, creates and configures unit tests for a class and stubs all external dependencies.

1. Create the following dummy classes header in `mbed-os/example/include/example`:

    **MyClass.h**

    ```
    #ifndef MYCLASS_H_
    #define MYCLASS_H_

    namespace example {

    class MyClass {
    public:
        int myFunction();
    };

    }

    #endif
    ```

1. Add a new `mbed-headers-example` interface library: 

   ### Stub CMake input source file

   ```
   target_include_directories(mbed-headers-example
    INTERFACE
        ${MBED_PATH}/example
        ${MBED_PATH}/example/include
        ${MBED_PATH}/example/include/example
    )
    ```

1. Add the newly created `mbed-headers-example` library into exising target link library of `mbed-headers`.

1. Create the following dummy classes source in `mbed-os/example/source`:

    **MyClass.cpp**

    ```
    #include "MyClass.h"
    
    namespace example {

    int MyClass::myFunction() {
        OtherClass o = OtherClass();
        return o.otherFunction();
    }

    }
    ```

1. Create a directory for MyClass unit tests in `mbed-os/example/tests/UNITTESTS/MyClass`.
1. Create a source and CMake configuration file for MyClass unit tests in `mbed-os/example/tests/unittests/MyClass`:

    **test_MyClass.cpp**

    ```
    #include "gtest/gtest.h"
    #include "example/MyClass.h"

    class TestMyClass : public testing::Test {
    protected:
        example::MyClass *obj;

        virtual void SetUp()
        {
            obj = new example::MyClass();
        }

        virtual void TearDown()
        {
            delete obj;
        }
    };

    TEST_F(TestMyClass, constructor)
    {
        EXPECT_TRUE(obj);
    }

    TEST_F(TestMyClass, myfunction)
    {
        EXPECT_EQ(obj->myFunction(), 0);
    }
    ```

    ### CMake input source file for UUT
    ```
    set(TEST_NAME myclass-unittest)

    add_executable(${TEST_NAME})
  
    target_sources(${TEST_NAME}
        PRIVATE
            ${MBED_PATH}/example/tests/unittests/MyClass/MyClass.cpp
            test_MyClass.cpp
    )
    
    target_link_libraries(${TEST_NAME}
        PRIVATE
            mbed-headers
            mbed-stubs            
            gmock_main
    )
    
    add_test(NAME "${TEST_NAME}" COMMAND ${TEST_NAME})
    
    set_tests_properties(${TEST_NAME} PROPERTIES LABELS "example")
    ```

This example does not use any Mbed OS code. If your unit tests do, remember to update header stubs in `UNITTESTS/target_h` and stubs sources in `UNITTESTS/stubs` with any missing type or function declarations.

### Building and running unit tests

#### Mbed CLI 1

- Install [Mbed CLI 1](../build-tools/mbed-cli-1.html) with `pip install mbed-cli` command in Debian or Ubuntu or macOS or Windows and make sure that installed Mbed CLI 1 version 1.8.0 or newer.

- Mbed CLI 1 supports unit tests through the `mbed test --unittests` command. To learn how to use unit tests with Mbed CLI 1, please see the [unit testing documentation section](../build-tools/test-and-debug.html). For other information on using Mbed CLI 1, please see the [CLI documentation in handbook](../build-tools/mbed-cli-1.html).

#### Mbed CLI 2

- Mbed CLI 2 does not currently support the `mbed test --unittests` command, please use CMake and a Make command directly.

#### Build tests directly with CMake

1. Create a build directory: `mkdir UNITTESTS/build`.
1. Move to the build directory: `cd UNITTESTS/build`.
1. Run CMake using a relative path to the `UNITTESTS` folder as the argument. So from `UNITTESTS/build` use `cmake ..-DMBED_BUILD_UNITTESTS=ON`:
   - Add `-g [generator]` if generating files other than Unix Makefiles. For example, for MinGW, use `-g "MinGW Makefiles"`.
   - Add `-DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=<value>`, `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<value>` and `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=<value>` to use a specific Make program and compilers.
   - Add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` for a debug build.
   - Add `-DCOVERAGE=True` to add coverage compiler flags.
   - Add `-Dgtest_disable_pthreads=ON` to run in a single thread.
   - See the [CMake manual](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake.1.html) for more information.
1. Run a Make program to build tests.

#### Run tests directly with CTest

Run a test binary in the build directory to run a unit test suite. To run multiple test suites at once, use the CTest test runner. Run CTest with `ctest`. Add `-v` to get results for each test case. See the [CTest manual](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/ctest.1.html) for more information.

#### Run tests with GUI test runner

1. Install `gtest-runner` according to the [documentation](https://github.com/nholthaus/gtest-runner).
1. Run `gtest-runner`.
1. Add test executables into the list and run.

### Debugging

1. Use Mbed CLI to build a debug build. For advanced use, run CMake directly with `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`, and then run a Make program.
1. Run GDB with a test executable as an argument to debug unit tests.
1. Run tests with Valgrind to analyze the test memory profile.

### Get code coverage

Use Mbed CLI to generate code coverage reports. For advanced use, follow these steps:

1. Run CMake with both `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` and `-DCOVERAGE=True`.
1. Run a Make program to build the tests.
1. Run the tests.
1. Run Gcovr or any other code coverage tool directly in the build directory.

### Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Generic problems with CMake or with the build process.
- **Solution**: Delete the build directory. Make sure that CMake, g++, GCC and a Make program can be found in the path and are correct versions.

**Problem:** (Windows) Virus protection identifies files generated by CMake as malicious and quarantines the files.
- **Solution**: Restore false-positive files from the quarantine.

**Problem:** (Windows) Git with shell installation adds sh.exe to the path and then CMake throws an error: sh.exe was found in your PATH. For MinGW make to work correctly, sh.exe must NOT be in your path.
- **Solution**:  Remove sh.exe from the system path.

**Problem:** (Mac OS) CMake compiler check fails on Mac OS Mojave when using GCC-8.
- **Solution**: Make sure gnm (binutils) is not installed. Uninstall binutils with `brew uninstall binutils`.
